# Steganography-Tool
Steganography Tool with GUI

This application enables users to securely hide text messages within image files and later extract them, demonstrating practical application of data security and encryption concepts.
Key Features

Message Encoding: Embeds encrypted text messages into image files without visibly altering the image.
Message Decoding: Extracts and decrypts hidden messages from processed images.
Graphical User Interface: Intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
File Handling: Supports various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG) for input and output.
Encryption: Utilizes the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme for enhanced security.
Error Handling: Robust error management for improved user experience.
